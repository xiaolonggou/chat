# Chat App

A simple Flutter application that simulates a chat interface, including mock data for chats, chatters, and scenes. The app allows users to view a list of chat threads, each labeled with participants, scene, and the last message. It also provides an option to add new chats using a floating action button.

## Features

- View a list of chats with details:
  - Participants
  - Scene context
  - Last message
- Floating action button to add a new chat (currently mock functionality)
- Navigation through 4 main sections: 
  - Chats
  - Chatters
  - Scenes
  - Settings

## Installation
